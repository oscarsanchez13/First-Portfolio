        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Hi again! My full name is Oscar Alexis Sanchez Ascencio. I was born in Jalisco, Mexico in the beautiful city of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guadalajara,+Jalisco,+Mexico/@20.6737777,-103.4054536,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8428b18cb52fd39b:0xd63d9302bf865750!8m2!3d20.6596988!4d-103.3496092" target="_blank">Guadalajara</a>. At the age of 7, my parents and I migrated to the United States (Carson city, Nevada) to work for our family's chain of restaurants. 7 years later, we relocated to Arkansas to further grow the family business. From the age of 9 to 18, I worked my way up from washing dishes to eventually a store manager. I split off from my family's restaurants to achieve success on my own, all while attending college full time for Computer Aided Drafting (CAD). After getting my Associates Degree in CAD, I pursued a Bachelors Degree in Architectural Engineering. In addition to my studies, I worked as an area supervisor for an important restaurant chain and streamed video game gameplay on Facebook as a hobby to earn extra income. My life seemed set to follow the path of Architectural Engineering until one Monday morning at 2:00am, 2020, when I came across a random video on YouTube over <em>Coding and Software Engineering</em>. Soon after, I signed up for free coding classes and fell in love with the profession. In October 2020, I enrolled in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">THINKFUL</a>'s Coding Academy and here is where my role as Software Engineer began! Who would have guessed watching a random suggested video at 2:00am on a Monday morning would create "potentially" one of America's Best Future Software Engineers. That is my American Dream.</p>

        <h3>Passion for Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>My interest for computers began at the ago of 6 when my grandmother would take me to the town's computer lounge and pay 5 <em>pesos</em> to play computer games for an hour. As I grew older, I became further intrigued in the field of computing and design. I attended college for Computer Aided Drafting and later Architectural Engineering but ultimately chose to follow the path of Full-Stack Software Engineering and have loved every bit of it! My favorite part about Software Development is working with other Developers to create fun and innovating products that others can enjoy.</p>
